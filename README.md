# Nothing.py
This is a little thing i did on python a while ago at this point. I wonder what it can give you... (not a virus idk how to make one lol)
(Obviously this requires Python to run. I made this with version 3.10 so you guess what version you need to run this thing.)
I hope you enjoy this thing (i hope so, it is my first python project after all.)
